## What is this?
fPlan is a really quick implementation of a space planning interface. Basically if you have an svg map and you want to put some dots that correlate to people onto that map, this will do that. If you want anything more complex feel free to alter the code to fit your needs.

I'm putting this out there because I've found need to make nearly this same project twice now and never again!

## Demo
Just download and open the index.
Everything should be straightforward.
Loading a saved json will overwrite everything. Uploading under the "people" tab will append the fresh list. Expected input is file with names separated by line breaks.

Make sure you click the "toggle edit" button to enable click-adding of new seats.

Enjoy.
## Dependencies
This uses angularjs, d3, font-awesome, and a bit of bootstrap.
