## What is this?
fPlan is a really quick implementation of a space planning interface. Basically if you have an svg map and you want to put some dots that correlate to people onto that map, this will do that. If you want anything more complex feel free to alter the code to fit your needs.

I'm putting this out there because I've found need to make nearly this same project twice now and never again!

## Demo
Just download and open the index.html
Everything should be straightforward.
